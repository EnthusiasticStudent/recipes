Chicken Spinach Lasagne á la Eric
This is a slightly modified recipe from the one in the dinner.pdf. In my experience the one in the dinner.pdf becomes too dry, so i’ve upped the dosage on some of the ingredients.
Ingredients
500 g chicken
500 g spinach
50-75 g butter
200 g lasagne-pasta plates
2 onions
5 tsp curry
1 tsp cumin (spidskommen)
1-2 tsp oregano
2 cans of chopped tomato
250 mL cooking cream
400 g cheddar cheese
cooking oil (majs)
salt & pepper
Instructions
Slice the chicken into strips and sauté it in a pan with some oil. Spice it with some salt and pepper, then put it aside.
Peel all the stems off the spinach and rinse the leaves well in water. Let the water drip off.
Melt the butter (start with 50 g and add more if necessary) in a pot and add the spinach. Turn the spinach in the melted butter until it collapses (it becomes dark-green and fills a lot less). [The recipe says you should let the spinach dry off again from the butter, but my experience is that you get better results if you do not].
Peel and chop the onions.
Warm 1-2 tsp oil and sauté the curry in a pan.
Add the onion and sauté.
Add tomatoes, cream, cumin, oregano, salt and pepper. Let is simmer.
Grate the cheese.
In a buttered pan add the chicken, some spinach, some tomato-sauce, some cheese and some pasta plates. Do this sequentially and end with tomato-sauce and cheese.
Bake for 40 min at 180 C. Cover the pan after 15 min with tin-foil to avoid burning the cheese.
